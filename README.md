- We’re a small yet fast growing startup based out of Singapore and HCM. We have a strong engineering culture and understand what it takes to build a scalable software company.
- We are obsessed with code quality and code reusability, we refactor, clean up, and think about how to optimize our code everyday.
- Read how our co-founder [designed a data pipeline](http://engineering.viki.com/blog/2014/data-warehouse-and-analytics-infrastructure-at-viki/) that handled more than 100M messages a day. Joining us you’ll fully understand the Big Data landscape that people are talking about, down to the smallest technical level. 
- We recently collaborated with Grokking to teach the [BigData Engineering Course](https://www.facebook.com/grokking.engineering/photos/?tab=album&album_id=1270606876340611) in Ho Chi Minh City.

Our offices are in:

* Singapore
* Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam
* Jakarta, Indonesia

# Our Customers

Our customers are tech startups like **Grab**, **Traveloka** (Indonesian unicorn startup), The Coffee House (VN), Tech In Asia, 99.co, ShopBack, KFIT, Aviasales, etc.


## Requirements
You'll get to work on all aspects of our product and platform: from front-end visualizations, implementing scalable, data-heavy features, helping customers with their complex SQL, to managing our servers that processed thousands of heavy jobs everyday.

- **Culture & Mindset:** You’re a team player; you want to understand how it’s like working for a startup -- doing anything and everything needed (from writing blog posts, to help customers with their data problem)
- **Technical Skills:** you are smart, fast-learner. It doesn't matter what programming languages you know, we'll teach you what we know. Btw, we use Ruby, PostgreSQL, Redis, AngularJS, ES6 and a lot of SQLs.
- **Communications:** Decent English skills

## Interesting Engineering Projects
Some interesting engineering projects we do at Holistics:

- Writing a database abstraction layer to interface with different database technologies at once: PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redshift, BigQuery, Presto
- Implement alert monitoring system using statistical algorithms
- ETL customer’s data from MongoDB to relational DBs with minimal overhead.
- Parsing SQL into an AST (abstract syntax tree) to understand semantics and suggest optimizations
- Build a sandboxed environment to execute arbitrary Python code that still ensures security

## Our Engineering Culture
- We don’t fancy free food or ping pong table, we focus on building an environment where our engineers can be productive and concentrate on solving good problems
- Our engineers own the product from end to end. They are involved in and get to speak directly with the customers to understand how they’re using it.
- We don’t write bad code to rush for deadline. We prefer spending more time refactoring the code over shipping bad code.
